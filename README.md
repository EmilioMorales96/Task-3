# Non-Transitive Dice - Fair Collaborative Game

This project implements a mathematical model of non-transitive dice with fair collaborative random number generation using HMAC with SHA3 to ensure that neither party can cheat.

---

## Description

The program allows players to define custom dice (with any number of faces and values), representing non-transitive relationships. The selection of dice and the dice rolls are conducted fairly and verifiably:

- A secure random number and secret key are generated by the computer.
- An HMAC is computed and shown to the user before their input.
- The user provides their number.
- The final result is computed using modular addition.
- The secret key is revealed, allowing the user to verify that the computer didnâ€™t cheat.

The first fair number determines who selects their die first. Each player must choose a different die. Then, both roll their dice using a fair protocol. A help menu shows a win probability table between all dice.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (requires `crypto` module and ES Modules support)
- Terminal with standard input/output support

---

## Usage

Run the application with 3 or more dice passed as command-line arguments:

```bash
node index.js dice1 dice2 dice3 ...


Example: node index.js 2,2,4,4,9,9 1,1,6,6,8,8 3,3,5,5,7,7
